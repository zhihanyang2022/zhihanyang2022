### Tips on debugging machine learning code

- Do a lot of shape checking (use print statements or debugger).
- Find a working repository and try to mold it into your code - then you can tell the differences. 
- Ask someone else to look at it.

### Good resources on reinforcement learning

- [OpenAI Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html)
  - They have the clearest explanation of DDPG. To me, it was much easier to read then the original paper.
