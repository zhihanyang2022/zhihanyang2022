### About me

- Name: Zhihan
- Pronouns: he/him/his
- Major: Mathematics (for me, writing is hard, so math is an easier major)
- Affiliation: Carleton College (in Minnesota)
- Email: yangz2@carleton.edu (I love connecting with people)
- Research interests: machine learning theory, Python, PyTorch, deep reinforcement learning

### Tips on debugging machine learning code (and anecdotes)

- Do a lot of shape checking (use print statements or debugger) to prevent incorrect broadcasting.
  - In PyTorch, if you add a (64, ) and a (64, 1) tensor, you get a (64, 64) tensor. 
- Find a working repository and try to mold it into your code - then you can tell the differences. 
- Ask someone else to look at it.

### Surprisingly good resources on reinforcement learning

- [OpenAI Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html)
  - They have the clearest explanation of DDPG; it was much easier to read than the original paper.
- Think you can't use Mujoco? Well, think twice. Mujoco offers free student / 30-day trial licenses [here](https://www.roboti.us/license.html).

### Favorite quotes for curbing anxiety in the modern age

I think the modern age can be perfectly described by the phrase "high tech low life", a phrase used to describe cyberpunk worlds. 

Stop putting all your time in work
- Everyone should get rich and famous and get everything they dreamed of so they can see that's not the answer - Jim Carrey.
- Having meaningful relationships is the number one predictor for a happy life - Robert Waldinger in his TED talk.

Stop focusing on the abstract question "what is the meaning of life?"
- Pain is inevitable, but suffering is a choice - not me.
- To live a meaningful life (有意义), you should first strive to live an interesting and fun life (有意思) - a therapist.

Stop being too serious
- An un-examined life is not worth living, but an over-exmained life is no party either - a therapist.
- The existence of multiple alternatives makes it easy for us to imagine alternatives that don’t exist—alternatives that combine the attractive features of the ones that do exist. And to the extent that we engage our imaginations in this way, we will be even less satisfied with the alternative we end up choosing. So, once again, a greater variety of choices actually makes us feel worse - Barry Schwartz in The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less.

I'm just another human being trying to enjoy life in the face of many, many challenges. There were many nights for which I could not fall asleep. If I can do it, then you can do it!
