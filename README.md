### Favorite quotes for curbing anxiety in modern age

- I think everyone should get rich and famous and get everything they dreamed of so they can see that's not the answer - Jim Carrey.
- Pain is inevitable, but suffering is a choice - not me.
- To live a meaningful life (有意义), you should first strive to live an interesting and fun life (有意思) - not me.

### Tips on debugging machine learning code (and anecdotes)

- Do a lot of shape checking (use print statements or debugger) to prevent incorrect broadcasting.
  - In PyTorch, if you add a (64, ) and a (64, 1) tensor, you get a (64, 64) tensor. 
- Find a working repository and try to mold it into your code - then you can tell the differences. 
- Ask someone else to look at it.

### Good resources on reinforcement learning

- [OpenAI Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html)
  - They have the clearest explanation of DDPG; it was much easier to read than the original paper.
- Think you can't use Mujoco? Well, think twice. Mujoco offers free student / 30-day trial licenses [here](https://www.roboti.us/license.html).
